# Tech Jobs OO

This app is an evolution of Tech Jobs Console. 
It improves upon the design of the original application by implemting object oriented design (hence the "OO").
The logic of the original application was abstracted into various classes. This version also has another
significant difference from the original in that it allows the user to create their own
job postings (whereas the original only allowed users to filter and search for preexisting postings).

### Overview
The essence of the abstracting logic into classes can be seen in the image below. The root of each job field (e.g. employer,
location, etc) is coded into an abstract class. Each field then extends the blueprint of that class as to avoid unnecessarily
repeating code. Each job becomes its own object that contains many job fields.
